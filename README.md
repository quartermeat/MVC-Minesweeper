# MVC-Minesweeper
A C# windows form version of minesweeper.  Basically did it as a project to learn C# from Java and deal with EventHandling outside of the Window.  
The Minesweeper namespace assemblies as a .dll so the game can be embedded into any project as long as the Minesweeper object is created.
